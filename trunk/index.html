				<a href="http://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> is an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Like a garden, a curated encyclopedia makes some weeding necessary. All articles, especially new ones, are closely reviewed by the community to determine if they meet Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" target="_blank">notability criteria</a>. Any editor can nominate an article for deletion and, if this nomination is legitimate, a community discussion takes place where any fellow <strike>gardeners</strike> editors have the opportunity to make their voices heard. The usual process is to have a week-long discussion during which community members can discuss in favor or against keeping the article, at the end of which an administrator speaks the final verdict (depending on whether consensus has been reached or not). If the admin concludes that consensus has not been reached, Wikipedia's policies recommend that the article be kept. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We analyzed and visualized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" target="_blank">Article for Deletion (AfD)</a> discussions. The visualization above represents the 100 longest discussions that resulted in the deletion of the respective article. AfD discussions are represented by a thread starting at the bottom center. Each time a user recommends to <em>keep</em>, <em>merge</em>, or <em>redirect</em> the article a green segment leaning towards the left is added. Each time a user recommends to <em>delete</em> the article a red segment leaning towards the right is added. As the discussion progresses, the length of the segments as well as the angle slowly decay. An ideal discussion in which there is total agreement among participants would approximately look like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral">logarithmic spiral</a>, as in <a class="trigger img" rel="#afd_spiral" title="spiral-like AfD sample">this case</a>.

				<h2>Some interesting facts about AfD discussions</h2>
				<p>
				Long AfD discussions are exceptional and not all AfD discussions are as crowded as those represented above. The longest AfD discussions do not give a representative picture of how this process works in most cases. The <a href="#ref">analysis of a large sample of AfD discussions</a> (198,083 discussions that took place between November 2002 and July 2010) suggests that the largest part of these discussions ends after only a few recommendations are expressed.

				<p>
				Splitting up the chart by the outcome of the discussion, and the vote distribution, reveals further interesting facts:
				<ul>
					<li>Not all AfD discussions start with a <em>delete</em> recommendations: sometimes the initial nominator directly proposes to merge or redirect the entry.</li>
					<li>A typical discussion consists of only three or four recommendations. Indeed, most topics deleted so quickly are less relevant even of the least amusing notabilia or trivia.</li>
					<li>Quite a few discussions are closed with a <em>keep</em> decision right after the initial nomination, overriding it. Deletions occurring after only one recommendation is expressed, in comparison, are much more rare.</li>
					<li>Delete decisions tend to be fairly unanimous. In contrast, we found many <em>keep</em> decisions following a discussion leaning towards deletion: this can happen if no clear consensus emerged from the discussion, or if people advocating deletion did not appeal to the right policy. In general, this means that administrators tend to apply the deletion guidelines in a conservative way.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="container">
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#ref">Further analysis</a> shows that consensus is often hard to reach. The figure below (left) shows the distribution of <em>duration</em> (in seconds) of AfD discussions. While the vast majority lasts <em>less than one week</em>, there is a sizable minority that takes up to two weeks or more. Some discussions took more than one year to be closed!</li>
					<li>How passionate are these discussions? The figure below (right) shows the distribution of <em>activity rates</em> (in "votes" per second), i.e. how fast new participants join a discussion. In general, <em>one new participant per day</em> is the norm but in many cases the activity rate can increase to one new participant every half an hour.</li>
